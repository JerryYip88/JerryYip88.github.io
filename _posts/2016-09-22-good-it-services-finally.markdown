Good IT services are so difficult to find nowadays. I got some IT issues at work and called the technical company to help out. The staff said they would figure that out. I never heard from them again. 

Now there is a new company, Fuji Xerox, providing IT services for the office.

The staff are so professional that they would get back to me if I have problems. They are fixed within hours. So good! Donâ€™t have to worry whenever I have technical issues now.
