Yesterday I saw a companyâ€™s banner with personalization printing on the street. It was designed to fit the company. Then I wondered how a printer, like the one at home, could make such large and personalization printing.

Later I found out that companies like Fuji Xerox are able to create personalization printing for enterprises, of course not using the printers we have at home. https://www.fujixerox.com.hk/en_us/products/digital-workflow-solutions/personalized-communications
The color was very sharp and the pictures eye-catching! Such a pleasure to see it on the street.
